What would be nice is if the page went like:
         
1. Assumptions needed to run a t-test
2. Formula for the t-test, with a "where ..." section explain each variable
3. boxes to put in your own numbers to get a statistic (remember there is a sample and a population formula) and a p value
4. not entirely sure, but maybe also 2 code boxes to show how to code it in R and Python?
