# Roll The Dice!

Welcome! Everything is a HUGE work in progress, but eventually this will be a statistics calculator program.

# How to run

You can either use this application running on Streamlit at [INSERT WEBSITE], or install it locally.

First, clone the repository:
``` {bash}
git clone https://github.com/coreymichaud/roll-the-dice.git
```

Then, run ```uv sync``` to install dependencies and create the virtual environment.

Once that's completed, you may do:
``` {bash}
streamlit run main.py
```
